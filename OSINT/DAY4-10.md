# OSINT - DAY 4 (12 Jan) to DAY 10 (18 Jan)

## DAY 4 (12 Jan)

Note: More CODE than OSINT was investigated this day

/gotham-city 
/gotham-engine 
/gotham-public

As noted previously it seems ZenGo uses a **naming convention based around famous cities...** 

note: all three /gotham repos are all 100% Rust code

The Whitepaper for the design can be found in the repo

"Bitcoin Wallet Powered by Two-Party ECDSA"
https://github.com/ZenGo-X/gotham-city/tree/master/white-paper

The paper is 6 years old and references/KZen-networks - KZen is the former name of ZenGo

### /gotham-city

"fully functional client/server application for issuing two party ECDSA signatures"

Cryptographic libraries:

/secp256k1 - used in Bitcoin secp256k1 signing
/two-party-ecdsa - Lindell's Crypto17 paper  

image of design from the repo:
https://github.com/ZenGo-X/gotham-city/raw/master/misc/ecdsa-illustration.png 

/gotham-city/cargo.toml

4 workspace members (potential attack surfaces)
- demo-wallet
- gotham-server
- gotham-client
- integration-tests

Rust Dependencies listed:
gotham-server
gotham-client
serde
serde_json
...
[FOR THE FULL LIST OF RUST DEPENDENCIES SEE: LINK TO BE ADDED]

## Folders within /gotham-city
- demo-wallet
- gotham-client
- gotham-server
- integration-tests
- misc
- white-paper

the first 3 contain code to run the gotham-city program - the 'members' in the cargo.toml
integration-tests is for testing if the code works well after building it on your OS

### misc
some images... but also a demo.gif 

**rabbithole** [follow it on Twitter](https://twitter.com/NicLazTweets/status/1745506588129919203)

Overviewed what code commenting is and then looked into all previous edits of the README.md file of /gotham-city

You can find the [unedited README.md in this part of the repo](https://github.com/niclaz/zengo-wallet-challenge/tree/niclaz/OSINT/Github/gotham-city) you will find:

- (hidden) http://README.md - hidden is the just the text that was commented out
- (uncommented) http://README.md - uncommented is with the commented back in
- gotham-city-demo.gif - a copy of the original demo.gif


### white-paper

In this folder there are PDF and .tex versions of the Gotham City whitepaper:

https://github.com/ZenGo-X/gotham-city/tree/master/white-paper


### OSINT - MEDIA

Noticed some information leaked through the comments by team to a Cointelegraph blog post
https://cointelegraph.com/news/wallet-developer-offers-on-chain-bounty-daring-hackers-430k-btc

[ADD SCREENSHOT]

- Clearing up doubts I had about Recovery in case of MPC network failure, there is a 3rd party law firm used for recovery
- Also confirmed that only 2 of the 3 factors will be shared in Challenge




## DAY 5 (13 Jan)

Day 5 was a focus on retracing the commit history of gotham-city as a respository

To assist in understanding the code base, where is came from, and maybe leak elements we should investigate as possible attack vectors

You can find [all my commments and notes on this process in this part of the repo](https://github.com/niclaz/zengo-wallet-challenge/tree/niclaz/CODE/ZenGo-X/gotham-city)

- commit-observations-0.0.0(alpha).md
- commit-observations-0.1.0-0.1.4.md
- commit-observations-1.0.0-1.2.0.md
- commit-observations-1.2.0-2.0.0.md

I also created a code-search-terms.md to keep collecting insteresting value or variables in the code to help future code review searches

[Direct link to code-search-terms.md](https://github.com/niclaz/zengo-wallet-challenge/blob/niclaz/CODE/ZenGo-X/gotham-city/code-search-terms.md)


## DAY 6 (14 Jan)

ZenGo confirms that their white hat rules apply to the Challenge: https://twitter.com/ZenGo/status/1746517958245892347

"Our primary focus is on vulnerabilities that:
Would allow attackers to spend customers’ money.
Would allow attackers to make customers’ money unavailable.
High severity attacks on the server"

[ADD SCREENSHOT] 

- no DoS / DDoS
- no social engineering (phishing, etc)
- no SSL/TLS config attacks on server
- yes RCE on server
- yes to SQL injection... but no to taking the servers down (DoS / DDoS)

## VIDEO - 1st HINT

3 factors for secure recovery
- email address
- ZenGo recovery file (not seed, privkey or secret share)
- 3D FaceLock 

HINT: email of the account of Challenge wallet

> zengowalletchallenge@mailinator.com

Do watch the full video: https://twitter.com/ZenGo/status/1746555618171797869


### Mailinator

Mailinator allows you to have a 'public inbox': https://mailinator.com/v4/public/inboxes.jsp?to=zengowalletchallenge

Link or at the top of the page main webpage enter 'zengowalletchallenge' or use the link below

You may see 'confirm your email' messages there from people trying to register the app (that is why it is a public inbox)

That said they only have 1 of the 3 factors for account recovery... missing a file and a 3D model of someone's face within the team... 

### VIDEO - RECOVERY WALKTHROUGH

Ari of the team does a video walk through of how to recover a ZenGo wallet - worth watching if you with to go the  **Account Recovery route**

https://twitter.com/ZenGo/status/1746555621325848744

### OSINT - EMAIL ACCOUNT SIGNUP

What can we discover from the email signup process?

Both signup and welcome emails (in mailinator public inbox) have buttons and they point to this domain: https://redirectingat.com

[ADD SCREENSHOT]

redirectingat are actually http://skimlinks.com which is owned by http://taboola.com

So they use affiliate marketing trackers in the their links, this means added complexity to the request to the wallet app when you click the button (additional data) and also an additional system that the wallet depends on...

> Potential vector of entry for RCE

First request from signup button:

> /?id=19823X771710&xs=1&sref=http://mailinator.com&url=https%3A%2F%http://2Fapp.zengo.com%2Fmagiclink%2F%3FuserAuthenticationCode%3D63d91b3e-2b0d-4fb0-8410-bbd4d09d13e8

Deconstructed:

id=19823X771710

xs=1

sref=http://mailinator.com

url=https://app.zengo.com/magiclink/?userAuthenticationCode=63d91b3e-2b0d-4fb0-8410-bbd4d09d13e8

url desconstructed

userAuthenticationCode=63d91b3e-2b0d-4fb0-8410-bbd4d09d13e8

from my reading the userAuthenticationCode of magiclink changes with each request. That above auth code is not unique to the HINT email.

but... from all the links I looked at the redirectingat.com id was always 19823X771710

Magiclink is a passwordless login method - when on your phone it would seek to open the ZenGo wallet app, or probably fallback to the AppStore prompting you to download it.

Is magiclink awesome? yeah but everything has tradeoffs, here are some for this method of authenticating  via magiclink <screenshot>

And the additional parameters:

xs=1

sref=http://mailinator.com

...

Since all the requests in the mailinator inbox are pointing to this url, we can assume the id above is for Zengo within redirectingat


## DAY 7 - 8 (15 - 16 Jan)

Looked further into the mailinator emails and links, and put the results in the github repository:

https://github.com/niclaz/zengo-wallet-challenge/tree/niclaz/OSINT/Email/Mailinator

This lead to some non-invasive domain probing using dnsdumpster and collecting domain data points:

https://github.com/niclaz/zengo-wallet-challenge/tree/niclaz/OSINT/Domain

Cleanup of README.md previous DAYX.md files

## DAY 9 (17 Jan)

Certik hosted a Twitter Spaces on the Challenge with Ari and Tal from the team: https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1rmxPMBmyBLKN

Notes from the Spaces:
- This was a more technical Twitter Space on the Wallet Design
- CertiK Security researcher (0pwnedlol) was impressed during their review in [Q1 2023](https://www.certik.com/resources/blog/7nffL7PQxjmt5enMXU9zL-fortifying-zengo-unearthing-and-defending-against-privileged-user-attacks)
- Tal overviews MPC vs traditional seed phrase wallets and how the MPC works @ 19:30 minute
- ZenGo allows a multiparty to compute the function of creating a key & signing a message without single point of failure
- MPC is now considered best solution for institutional custody, zengo is one of the few bringing it to retail consumers
- Zengo system creates 2 shares for this key - one of the use device, and the other on a secure zengo server (this is cryptographic work), and they also have additonal MFA via a server-side biometric authentication (3D FaceLock) for recovery of the 2 shares, none of these 3 factors are a password and reduce the single point of failure danger.

Certik experience during their audit (0pwnedlol):
- When compared to other customer grade MPC wallets, Zengo is the most popular in market
- Zengo implementing their own MPC solution and that they had Open Source code were important factors
- "To us it is a transparent top-grade target, period." @0pwnedlol

Tal's comments on the Challenge
- "bad randomness is the perfect crime of cryptography" @Tal
- the MPC setup of ZenGo (2 shares on 2 different parties) means there is no single point of failure from bad random number generation, since the computation is a distributed.
- for example with a faulty random number generator in the mobile device, does not lead to low entropy seed phrase since the random number generation on the server for the the other share leads to more resilience
- defence in depth principle in their design decisions
- Bounty is just one part of a larger security program for white hats and auditors, improving report quality and relationships
- Tal does not expect anyone to find big issues with the protocol, but there may be smaller issues/vulnerabilites
- The challenge is also about learning the infrastructure of MPC wallets, instead of single-point seed phrase systems
