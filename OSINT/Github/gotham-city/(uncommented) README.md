Gotham City
=====================================
Gotham city is a fully functional client/server application for issuing two party ECDSA signatures.

-------
### Server
Gotham **server** is an ECDSA agnostic signing machine.
List of supported Curve(s):

 * secp256k1

### Client
You can see a full fledged example of a client which connects to gotham server under: [integration-tests/test_ecdsa_key_signing](https://github.com/ZenGo-X/gotham-city/blob/master/integration-tests/tests/ecdsa.rs#L109)

List of supported Coin&#40;s&#41;:

 * BTC


**Extending the client to support more coin&#40;s&#41; is easy as long as the Elliptic Curve and signing scheme of the new blockchain are supported. In the case a blockchain is using secp256k1 together with ECDSA, the same keygen and signing code can be reused.**

### Design Overview

#### ECDSA Keygen and Signing
![ECDSA](misc/ecdsa-illustration.png)
* For details on Threshold Signatures see [Threshold Signatures: The Future of Private Keys](https://medium.com/kzen-networks/threshold-signatures-private-key-the-next-generation-f27b30793b)

#### Cryptographic libraries
* [secp256k1](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-secp256k1/): Rust language bindings for Bitcoin secp256k1 library.
* [two-party-ecdsa](https://github.com/ZenGo-X/two-party-ecdsa): Rust implelemtation of Lindell's Crypto17 paper: [Fast Secure Two-Party ECDSA Signing](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/552)

### White paper overview

#### Abstract

We demonstrate a Bitcoin wallet that utilizes two party ECDSA &#40;2P-ECDSA&#41;. Our architecture relies on a simple client-server communication model. We show support for 2 party deterministic child derivation&#40;2P-HD&#41;, secret share rotation and verifiable recovery. We discuss the opportunities and challenges of using a multi-party wallet.

#### Background
For end-users, cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based assets are hard to store and manage. One of the reasons is the tradeoff between security and availability.

Storing private keys safely requires dedicated hardware or extreme security measures which make using the coins on a daily basis difficult. 
Threshold cryptography provides ways to distribute the private key and digital signing.
This can potentially benefit security but at the same time reveal new challenges such as availability, ownership and recovery. 
Bitcoin is utilizing ECDSA as the signing scheme. There is an active line of research for practical and efficient multi-party ECDSA schemes.

# Benchmarks
In a local networking setup, with a MacBook Air M2, 8GB RAM and macOS 13.5:
* `cargo bench --bench keygen_bench` reports **762ms** 
* `cargo bench --bench sign_bench` reports **151ms** 

### Comperative Performance

The comparison was done on an Intel i9-8950HK &#40;2.9GHz&#41; using localhost for server &#40;no real network&#41;. The numbers are mean for 20 runs of 2P-ECDSA KeyGen and 50 runs for 2P-ECDSA Signing. Standard deviation is inconsistent but for both implementations it is order of magnitude smaller than mean value.
